# ACTPanda Installation Guide

Welcome to the ACTPanda repository! This guide will help you set up the project environment on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the setup, make sure to install ROS (Robot Operating System) if it's not already installed on your system.
 For installation instructions tailored to different operating systems, visit the [ROS Installation Page](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Start by cloning the ACTPanda repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sainavaneet/ACTPanda.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the ACTPanda Directory**  
   After cloning, change into the ACTPanda directory:
   ```
   cd ACTPanda/
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script**  
   Execute the setup script to install all necessary dependencies and configure your environment. In your terminal, run:
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script (you might need to use `chmod +x setup.sh` if the script is not executable).
